  It's about one moment. 


  The first musical from Tony Award winner, Jason Robert Brown (Parade, Bridges
  of Madison County), this moving collection of powerful songs examines life,
  love and the choices that we make.


  This musical song cycle will transport you from the deck of a 1492 Spanish
  sailing ship to a ledge, 57 stories above Fifth Avenue, to meet a startling
  array of characters that range from a young man who has determined that
  basketball is his ticket out of the ghetto to a woman whose dream of marrying
  rich nabs her the man of her dreams... and a soulless marriage.


  With a small, powerhouse cast and a driving, exquisitely crafted score that
  runs the gamut of today's popular music, Songs for a New World is the perfect
  way to come back to theatre.
