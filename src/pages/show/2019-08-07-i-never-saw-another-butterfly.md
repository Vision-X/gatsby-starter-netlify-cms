  There were no butterflies at Terezin, but for the children who lived there,
  butterflies became a symbol of defiance, making it possible for them to live
  on and play happily while waiting to be transported.

Over 15,000 Jewish children passed through Terezin, and only about a hundred were still alive when Terezin was liberated at the end of the war. One of the survivors, Raja, having lived through it all, teaching the children when there was nothing to teach with, helping to give them hope when there was little enough reason for hope, creating a little world of laughter, of flowers and butterflies behind the barbed wire, tells the true story of the children of Terezin.
