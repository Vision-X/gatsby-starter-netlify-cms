  Over 15,000 Jewish children passed through Terezin, and only about a hundred
  were still alive when Terezin was liberated at the end of the war. One of the
  survivors, Raja, having lived through it all, teaching the children when there
  was nothing to teach with, helping to give them hope when there was little
  enough reason for hope, creating a little world of laughter, of flowers and
  butterflies behind the barbed wire, tells the true story of the children. It's
  her play and it's theirs. There were no butterflies at Terezin, of course, but
  for the children, butterflies became a symbol of defiance, making it possible
  for them to live on and play happily while waiting to be transported.
